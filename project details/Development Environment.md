**Development Environment Description:**

**Backend:**
- **Node.js:** The backend is powered by Node.js, which allows for server-side JavaScript development.
- **Express.js:** Express.js is used as the web application framework to handle HTTP requests, routes, and middleware.
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database to store user and tree data.
- **Mongoose:** Mongoose is used as an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWTs are used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Bcrypt:** Bcrypt is utilized for password hashing and security.
- **Middleware:** Custom middleware functions, such as JWT verification, are employed to enhance security.

**Frontend (Vue.js):**
- The frontend is developed using the Vue.js framework, which enables the creation of interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- Vue Router is used for managing client-side routing, allowing users to navigate through different views within the application.
- Axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the backend API for data retrieval and interaction.
- Component-based architecture is followed for building reusable UI elements.

**Project Structure:**
- The project follows a structured directory layout with separate folders for controllers, middleware, models, routes, utilities, and frontend files.
- Controllers handle application logic for user and tree-related operations.
- Models define the data structures and schemas for users and trees, and they interact with the database.
- Routes define API endpoints for user and tree interactions.
- Middleware includes functions like JWT verification for securing routes.
- Utilities (UtilController) provide utility functions for gathering data, such as total user counts.
- The frontend directory contains Vue.js components, views, and other frontend-related files organized as per Vue.js conventions.

**Database:**
- The application uses a MongoDB database to store user data and tree-related information.

**Authentication:**
- User authentication is implemented using JWT tokens, ensuring secure user access.

**Development Tools:**
- Common development tools include code editors (Visual Studio Code), version control systems (Git), and package managers (npm).
- Vue CLI is used for setting up and managing the Vue.js project.

This development environment enables the creation of a robust and user-friendly tree simulation application with both server-side and client-side capabilities.
